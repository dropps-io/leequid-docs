# How it can be obtained

Acquiring sLYX is equivalent to either:

* creating a new staking position by staking through the platform, which triggers the addition of new validators to the protocol.
* buying someone elseâ€™s staked position, through direct transfer of sLYX or through market makers like the [LEEQUID liquidity pool](../the-liquidity-pool-dex/implementation.md).

The liquidity pool, deployed by the LEEQUID team on LUKSO, is the mechanism responsible for increasing the liquidity of the sLYX token. Users can deposit or withdraw LYX at any time by swapping its LSD (Liquid Staking Derivative), the sLYX token, in the liquidity pool.
