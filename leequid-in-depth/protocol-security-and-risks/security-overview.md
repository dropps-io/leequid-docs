# Security overview

Staking pools are one of the safest kinds of DeFi protocols available. That's because user funds end up stored in a smart contract developed over many years and extensively tested by the Ethereum team, called the _Deposit Contract_.&#x20;

Once LYX enters the Proof of Stake consensus mechanism, only a violation of the consensus rules can interfere with that LYX.&#x20;

There is no mechanism for the staking pool developers or admins to take control over user funds, so a "rug pull" is not possible by definition. Our liquid staking token, called _StakedLYX_ (sLYX), has no initial distribution, no treasury fund, and no share for the marketing, executive, or development teams. Its supply abides by the simplest of all rules:

> The amount of sLYX minted is equal to the LYX that enters the protocol. The amount of sLYX burned is equal to the LYX that exits the protocol. LYX enters and exits the protocol through staking and unstaking, respectively.

So, what is there to lose when staking through a staking pool? Practically speaking, nothing. In theory, LEEQUID runs an infrastructure of validators, and when a user stakes, he trusts LEEQUID to do its job properly and have the validators follow the rules of the consensus mechanism. Otherwise, as mentioned above, a violation of consensus rules results in sanctions to staked LYX.

LEEQUID took careful steps in assembling its validator infrastructure and choosing its node operator partners, following industry standards, and getting inspiration from major staking players in the market such as LIDO and Stakewise. Security in LEEQUID is at par with these million-dollar protocols which have sailed through all the upgrades in Proof of Stake implementation smoothly and without incidents.

Below is a table detailing the theoretical possible risks of a staking protocol for user consideration. Because prevention measures are in place, such risks never resulted in incidents in any major staking platform in the market.&#x20;
