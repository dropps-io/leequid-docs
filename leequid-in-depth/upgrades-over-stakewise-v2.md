# Upgrades over Stakewise V2

&#x20;Progress over Stakewise V2 includes:

* A full unstaking system, which effectively exits validators, recovering staked LYX and burning sLYX in the process. Exiting validators and withdrawing rewards became available for EVM blockchains like LUKSO after the [Shapella upgrade](https://blog.ethereum.org/2023/03/28/shapella-mainnet-announcement), on April 12th, 2023.
* The possibility to withdraw rewards to one's wallet. This means not only accruing them in the liquid staking token, but effectively transfer them as LYX, anytime, to a user controlled Universal Profile or Externally Owned Address.
* A stake/unstake buffer to match incoming deposits with outgoing withdrawals. This buffer can transform waiting periods of days into minutes.&#x20;
* Adjustment to the LSP7 token standard, making LEEQUID the first LUKSO native DeFi protocol.
* Update of solidity code to the newest version, benefiting from increased security and efficiency.&#x20;
