# Swapping sLYX for LYX

Any time a user wants to redeem his position in the LEEQUID protocol, he can do so either by swapping his sLYX tokens for LYX or initiating an unstake request.

The advantage of swapping is that it is an instant process, thus making the sLYX token as liquid as it can be. However, an exact 1:1 ratio between sLYX and LYX is not guaranteed and a liquidity provider fee will be deducted from the value to withdraw. We recommend reading the section about[ swapping ](../swapping/slyx-for-lyx-an-instant-alternative-to-exiting.md)before using the liquidity pool to redeem sLYX.
