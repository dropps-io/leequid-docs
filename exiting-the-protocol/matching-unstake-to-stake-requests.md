# Matching unstake to stake requests

In the beginning of the exit process, the LEEQUID protocol will try to match unstake requests to stake requests of new/onboarding users, cutting short the exit process and delivering reduced waiting times. A match can occur either on the total unstake request or on a fraction of the request value. In the scenario of a partial match, the user will see that only a fraction of LYX tokens have returned to his address. The rest will be available to claim once the exit process is finished and the LYX is returned from the LUKSO contract to the LEEQUID protocol.
