# Claim unstaked LYX

Exiting the protocol is never an instant process unless you exit via [swapping through the liquidity pool](../swapping/slyx-for-lyx-an-instant-alternative-to-exiting.md).

If you choose to exit through the staking pool, your stake will enter the [unstake flow](../exiting-the-protocol/option-2-unstaking-through-the-staking-pool.md) and once that process completes you'll be able to redeem your LYX from the protocol.&#x20;

Unstaking through the staking pool is a 2-step process: first, a user initiates the request, returning an amount of sLYX equal to the LYX to be withdrawn; then the user claims the exited LYX, in a second transaction.

The state of your unstake request in the LEEQUID platform will change once your coins are available to claim. This might take a few hours, and up to a few days. If you want to know more about the length of the unstaking process, refer to [this section](../exiting-the-protocol/potential-wait-times-while-unstaking.md) of the documentation.

If you only exit a portion of your stake and later exit the rest, two different unstake requests will be created, but they can be claimable all at once later on.

There is no limit to the time your coins can remain in the "Claimable" state. Once the exit process is finished at the Proof of Stake protocol level, your LYX will have moved from the LUKSO official deposit contract to the LEEQUID protocol and should remain available to claim for an indefinite period of time.&#x20;
