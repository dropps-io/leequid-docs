# Claim queued stake

Claiming sLYX is an action that is triggered manually by the user, by sending a transaction to the pool contract. This might be done through the LEEQUID platform, once a certain claim action is enabled. There is no time limit to claim sLYX tokens, but once they are available to claim, one will be missing on rewards until the moment the tokens are claimed. &#x20;

The reason why the minting of sLYX is delayed is due to an entering queue in the protocol. This queue is called the [dilution queue](../staking/potential-wait-times-while-staking.md#dilution-queue). In such scenario, your LYX is transferred to the LEEQUID protocol, but the minting of sLYX is delayed until your turn in the queue arrives and your stake is activated in newly registered validators. Once your staking request is fully processed, the sLYX tokens will no longer be in the “pending” state and you will be able to claim them through the dashboard connected to your wallet.
